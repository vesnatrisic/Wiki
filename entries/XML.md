# XML

XML stands for eXtensible Markup Language.
XML was designed to store and transport data.
XML was designed to be both human- and machine-readable.
XML is a software- and hardware-independent tool for storing and transporting data.
XML does not DO anything. XML is just information wrapped in tags.

##### XML and HTML were designed with different goals:

- XML was designed to carry data - with focus on what data is
- HTML was designed to display data - with focus on how data looks
- XML tags are not predefined like HTML tags are
